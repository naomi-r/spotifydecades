      <description>This section is written in markdown. It is used for discussion, explanation etc.
First let’s load our packages:
# load packages library(tidyverse) library(slumdown) This would usually be about waffles, but instead I will do something boring with cars and the mpg data frame. I will also illustrate the use of inline R commands 7.
pic &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) + theme_slum(palette = &amp;quot;kunoichi&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;Engine Displacement&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Highway Mileage&amp;quot;) This chunk has created the pic variable.</description>

      <description>Like any blogdown post, a slumdown post is written in R Markdown, and uses a few custom fields in the YAML field. This tutorial provides an illustration of how different kinds of content are displayed.</description>

      <title>Tutorial part 3: Colour palettes in slumdown</title>

      <guid>/post/colour-palettes/</guid>
      <description>The main reason I wrote slumdown (besides boredom) was to make it easy to  include user-defined colours palettes in blogdown, and expose those palettes to R so that (for instance) plots can be drawn in a style that matches the blog style. This tutorial introduces this palette system.</description>

      <description>Slumdown allows the user to control the background image at the top of each post, the profile image overlaid in the middle of that image, and the caption attached to the header image. This post describes how this is done.</description>

      <description>This tutorial describes how to deploy a site. Blogdown sites are very often deployed to Netlify, but I have a personal bias to use GitHub Pages, so &lt;em&gt;slumdown&lt;/em&gt; is configured by default to use GitHub.</description>

      <description>A simple project page illustrating how user-defined themes in &lt;em&gt;slumdown&lt;/em&gt; can be used as the basis of individual pages and ggplot2 figures. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do very much.</description>

      <description>The idea behind slumdown The slum theme for Hugo and blogdown is an adaptation Yihue Xie’s Xmin theme that borrows stylistic elements from the Tufte R Markdown theme and from the academic Hugo theme. Originally it was intended to be extremely minimal, with the very modest goal of trying to make sure I understood the logic of how Hugo generates static sites. The more I played with it though, the more I enjoyed it.</description>

 Here we’ll look at how audio features have changed for popular music over time:
We can draw some interesting insights from this graph:
 acousticness: There has been a dramatic decrease in acousticness over time. This is likely due to the development of electronic instruments and digital sound mixing, which created new genres such as pop and electronic music that dominate the Top 100’s</description>
