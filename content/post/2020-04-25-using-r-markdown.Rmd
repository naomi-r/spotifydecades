This section is written in markdown. It is used for discussion, explanation etc. 

First let's load our packages: 
```{r package load, message=FALSE}
# load packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(slumdown)

```

This would usually be about waffles, but instead I will do something boring with cars and the `mpg` data frame. I will also illustrate the use of inline R commands `r 1+6`. 

```{r picture}
pic <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) + 
  theme_slum(palette = "kunoichi") +
  xlab("Engine Displacement") +
  ylab("Highway Mileage")
```

This chunk has created the `pic` variable. To draw the plot, we just incldue the R command `print(pic)'

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
print(pic)

```
